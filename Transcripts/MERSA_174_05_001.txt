In my social psychology class today. Um The professor was talking about how men tend to prefer younger and attractive women. While women prefer men with resources such as rich older men, sort of genetically one student. I don't remember what exactly he said, but he said something along the lines of help women prefer rich, 40 years old man than broke, broke 40 years old man. And how that really is an attraction. The professor happened to be a man in his forties, I think so. He told us to not to talk bad about men in their forties in a joking way.
