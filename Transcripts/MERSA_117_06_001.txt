Uh, yesterday I heard the news about the, uh, shooting that happened in Nashville and it was really a heartbroken, breaking and I was terrified for all the students there and even the teachers who were there trying to save the Children. So it was a hopeless situation and I felt stressed, um, because of that situation.
