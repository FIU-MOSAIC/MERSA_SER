Yesterday I went to the arcade and one of my cousin went, uh, me a large teddy bear that he gave to cousin Pete's Bee's girlfriend. The bear was so large that she was pretty much dragging his dog on the ground. And today she said that when she got home, she apparently need her mom's help to carry it back home.
