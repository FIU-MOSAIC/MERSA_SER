Today before going to my classes, I noticed that my ID was missing but since I have left the dorm yet, at the time I was somewhere in the room and didn't worry about it. But when I came back and searched all over my book by that room, I couldn't find it anywhere and I thought that I might, yeah, I lost my tail again. And then I noticed the idea was actually in the pocket that I already searched all along.
