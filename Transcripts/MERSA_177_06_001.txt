Today, I finally got a document notarized to help me with my dependency override, use dependency override. Um Claims that I'm an independent and helps me get my money to go to school, which I need. So I'm very happy that I finally got it notarized because I've gone to six different banks and I'm very proud of myself for working hard in going to these different places to get what I need to get.
