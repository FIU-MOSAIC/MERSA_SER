To a professor, a professor today was telling a story about how his family once raised a goat and how his wife really adorned the goat. Then at one point, there was a party which it was serving goat meat. And he realized that that was pretty much the only reason his family was raising a goat. But without knowing that his wife ask at a later date about where the goat is. And the whole story was to talk about how it has become natural, but raising animals just to consume them is actually quite a crude thing.
