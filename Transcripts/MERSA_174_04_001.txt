My roommates sort of decorated the room for my birthday and they had the happy birthday stickers sticked to my room. There was also the banner where you can arrange the letter to spell words. I thought it said happy birthday, but apparently they couldn't find the age to pull out the banner. So it was actually happy birthday this whole time, which I only noticed today.
