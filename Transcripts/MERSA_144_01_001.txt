And today it was very flooded and there was a tornado warning. Well, I was, um, in class around 2 p.m. it was concerning for some people but, and I was ready to stay in the campus for as long as, um, I need to until things clear up. Then later on I realized it's better if I just go as early as possible to avoid it, the weather getting any worse.
