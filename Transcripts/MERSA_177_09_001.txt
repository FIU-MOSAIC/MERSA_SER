Today, I'm doing a paper for my persuasion class and I left it for the last minute. So, as of right now I'm just kind of nervous, anxious and jittery because I left it for the last minute and I'm scared, I'm not gonna be able to turn it in, in time and I kind of feel irritable since I left it. So last minute.
