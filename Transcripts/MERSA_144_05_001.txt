Say I had a group presentation for my BME class. Um It's where I needed to get some interviews um about artificial intelligence. Um In the medical field, I did well. In my part, I would say, you know, I didn't really need to look too much at my script and things were improvised. I'm pretty proud of myself for that. But overall, our group presentation did not do well. And my professor, he let us down. Um He let us down easy. Uh Yeah.
